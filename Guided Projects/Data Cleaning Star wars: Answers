Rankings
So far, we've cleaned up the data, renamed several columns, and computed the average ranking of each movie. As I suspected, it looks like the "original" movies are rated much more highly than the newer ones.

In [97]:
star_wars[star_wars.columns[3:9]].sum()
Out[97]:
seen_1    673
seen_2    571
seen_3    550
seen_4    607
seen_5    758
seen_6    738
dtype: int64
In [96]:
plt.bar(range(6), star_wars[star_wars.columns[3:9]].sum())
Out[96]:
<Container object of 6 artists>

View counts
It appears that the original movies were seen by more respondents than the newer movies. This reinforces what we saw in the rankings, where the earlier movies seem to be more popular.

In [98]:
males = star_wars[star_wars["Gender"] == "Male"]
females = star_wars[star_wars["Gender"] == "Female"]
In [99]:
plt.bar(range(6), males[males.columns[9:15]].mean())
plt.show()

plt.bar(range(6), females[females.columns[9:15]].mean())
plt.show()


In [100]:
plt.bar(range(6), males[males.columns[3:9]].sum())
plt.show()

plt.bar(range(6), females[females.columns[3:9]].sum())
plt.show()


Male/Female differences in favorite Star Wars movie and most seen movie
Interestingly, more males watches episodes 1-3, but males liked them far less than females did.
